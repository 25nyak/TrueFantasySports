## Fantasy Sports
Wikipidea
> A¬†fantasy sport is a type of game, where participants create virtual teams composed of proxies of real players of a professional sport. These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players in actual games. This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a contest rules selected by each fantasy team's owner.

## Problem with existing web2 platforms
    * User have to submit theirs team to centralized platform in order to participate
    * Platform is centralized  and completely controlled by the platform owners
    * Lack of transparency with respect to how other users joins the contests
    * End user have to trust platform to be fair and not cheat by creating the same team as theirs and putting it on same contest.
    * Limited and fixed game plays/rules offered by exisiting platform
    
## Solution
    * Create Trustless and Decentalized fanstasy sports platform using blockchain and zero knowledge proof system
    * Enabling complete transparency of the system using public blockchain
    * User don‚Äôt have to submit their team. User keeps its team to themself so that no one can copy the user team and cheat.
    * Using zkSnarks circuits platform proves the score gather by user‚Äôs team.
    * Provide users to pick from different game plays/rule to create contests.
